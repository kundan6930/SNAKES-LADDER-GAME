# SNAKES-LADDER-GAME
                                            ************** GAME RULES ****************
      .   A Snakes and Ladders board (the board contains numbers from 1 to 100, some snakes and some ladders).
      .   When a piece comes on a number which lies on the top of a snake (face of the snake), then the \n   piece/token will land below to the bottom of the snake (tail of it) that can also be said as an unlucky move.
      .  If somehow the piece falls on the ladder base, it will immediately climb to the top of the ladder\n   (which is considered to be a lucky move).
      .  Whereas if a player lands on the bottom of the snake or top of a ladder, the player will remain in the\n   same spot (same number) and will not get affected by any particular rule. The players can never move down ladders.
      .  The pieces of different players can overlap each other without knocking out anyone. There is no concept\n   of knocking out by opponent players in Snakes and Ladders.
      .  To win, the player needs to roll the exact number of die to land on the number 100. If he/she fails to do\n   so, then the player needs to roll the die again in the next turn. For example, if a player is on the number 98 and\n   the die roll shows the number 4, then the player cannot move its piece until he/she gets a 2 to win or 1 to be on the 99th number.
      .  The player who manages to be the first person to reach the top/final square on the board (usually the number 100) wins.
